# Register

Participation in the challenge is **free**. As a **pupil**, you just have to indicate your desire to participate in the challenge to a teacher at your school who is organising the challenge so that they can register you.

The management of pupil registrations for the challenge is therefore done by the **teacher**. There are several ways for a teacher to register:

::: details You have already participated in the challenge (online) previously
In this case, you can participate again without having to register again.

_You just need to use your current credentials to connect to the online challenge platform and you will be able to create and register your new classes and upload the list of your pupils._
:::

::: details You know a colleague who is already registered on the online challenge platform
In this case, your colleague can register you.

_You just have to give you email adresse to your colleague and directly ask him to register you on the online challenge platform._
:::

::: details You, or your colleagues, have never participated in the challenge
In this case, you must send an email to a [local contact](../../about/contact/) point.

_You just need to send an email to a local contact point specifying that you wish to participate to the Bebras challenge. Preferably use an official email address of your school (if you have one) and attach a scan or a picture of your official teacher card._
